# SelfMotivator
SelfMotivator is a program written in Polish language to help carry out different exercises at home - the program will count back time until the exercise finishes.
It is possible to set more exercise regimes which consist of several activities.
The activities are saved to SQLite database so once they are saved they can be used next time again.
